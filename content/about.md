  Well, not really. We’re [Snipcart](http://bit.ly/2YB7AUL)—a bunch of geeks
  from Québec City. Planty is a theme we built for
  [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/), a killer JAMstack site-builder. To
  enable e-commerce on Planty, you’ll need to [sign up for
  Snipcart](http://bit.ly/2YzKmhP). Testing is forever free, no credit card
  required.

      Now THAT is true, but we love web development even more. We talk about it
      on our blog, like, [a lot](http://bit.ly/2YA6999). We often craft live
      demos and open source these bad boys [on
      GitHub](https://github.com/snipcart). Matter of fact, this Planty theme
      [is open source too](https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty)!
      If you spot any bugs, open an issue, and we’ll fire our junior dev. Just
      kidding Michael, you’re good.

      Word. But good **code** _can_ solve a lots of problems, too. New _and_
      old. That’s why we help beginners get started with web development through
      free content and tools, like this theme. We also believe [the
      JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) might be one solid pillar on which we
      build that future.
